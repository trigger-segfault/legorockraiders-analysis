Contained is `LegoRR.gar` an archived copy of the project used for researching and labeling everything in the `LegoRR.exe` assembly. This will be updated infrequently due to its excessive file size. But it is invaluable for looking at the original codebase, as `source_dump` output is often fragmented, unreadable, or outright *wrong* in the more complex functions.

**Masterpiece/LegoRR.exe** - All work is being done within this item. Although `Community/` and `CLGen/` sections exists, neither are heavily focused on (and CLGen has been entirely rebuilt by hand anyway).
