# Ghidra Archive export

Contained in `LegoRR.gar` is an archived copy of the project used for researching and labeling everything in the `LegoRR.exe` assembly. This will be updated infrequently due to its excessive file size. But it is invaluable for looking at the original codebase, as `source_dump` output is often fragmented, unreadable, or outright *wrong* in the more complex functions.

**Ghidra archive version:** 10.0.4 PUBLIC
