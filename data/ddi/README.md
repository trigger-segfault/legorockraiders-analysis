# Data/DDI

Contained here is **legally-obtained** data from DDI archives that has relevance in reversing LEGO Rock Raiders (PC) edition.

* `Gods98/` - source code for a newer version of the engine framework used by LegoRR. Many functions and types remain identical, but what has been changed is pretty much already identified.
* `GodsPSX/` - a half-implemented engine framework used for PSX builds. This contains some additional data that's not found in Gods98, but none of it has yet to be a direct help with reversing LegoRR (PC).
* `RRPSX-D/` - debug symbols for a LEGO Rock Raiders (PSX) build. Although gameplay varies greatly between these two releases, many names may give hints at what PC is doing.
